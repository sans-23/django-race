   Don't depend on it for data security. Although I tried to maintain data integrity.
    Also there is limit for daily usage set by pythonanywhere as I'm using its free hosting service.</p>

   <p> If you can find any bug you can report it in feedback form below. Also I'm not too good at color selection,
so if you can help me to make this site more pretty then it would be highly appreciated. If you are learning frontend then its playground for you.
